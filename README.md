### Task description:
The dataset presents data on sales of new cars in Kazakhstan for 9 months of 2019. It is necessary to analyze the car market as a whole (capacity, dynamics, competitive environment) and assess the position of the Mercur Auto car center in the market: analysis of the external and internal environment of the car center.

### Conclusions based on the results of the car market analysis:
- The actual capacity of the passenger car market in Kazakhstan as of September 2019 is 48,629 units and $1,163,382,320, respectively.
- Lada, Toyota, and Hyundai are the market leaders in passenger car sales, both in units and dollars.
- All market leaders have SUV class cars in their portfolios. Unlike other market leaders, Toyota and Hyundai, Lada, the leader in unit sales, clearly focuses on B-class cars, which is logical since they are cheaper. Interestingly, Toyota's D-class cars sell very well, which is not observed with other brands.
- Nearly all passenger car sales occur in the two largest cities - Almaty and Nur-Sultan.
- There is no correlation between the price of a passenger car and the average salary in the corresponding region.
- The passenger car market is dominated by three companies: Astana Motors, Toyota Motor Kazakhstan, and Bipek Auto. Toyota Motor Kazakhstan is the undisputed leader in the passenger car market.
     - Toyota Motor Kazakhstan handles the Toyota and Lexus brands.
     - Astana Motors handles the Hyundai brand.
     - Bipek Auto handles the Kia, Lada, and Renault brands.
- The Toyota Camry is the undisputed leader in the passenger car market in terms of both unit sales and dollars.
- The actual capacity of the commercial vehicle market in Kazakhstan as of September 2019 is 5,246 units and $185,811,884, respectively.
- GAZ and KAMAZ dominate the commercial vehicle market, both in terms of units sold and dollars.
- The commercial vehicle market is divided among three leaders - TK Kamaz, Virazh, and Allur Auto.
    - Allur Auto handles the brands Ankai and Jac.
    - Virazh handles the GAZ brand.
    - TK Kamaz handles the Kamaz brand.
- Almaty is the leader in commercial vehicle sales. The Kostanay region surpassed Nur-Sultan in sales due to a spike in bus sales in July. Since the spike is a one-time event, it was likely due to a large tender shipment that significantly affected the sales distribution. Sales in Almaty are the most balanced, with all leading market brands represented. In the Kostanay region, Ankai sales dominate, while in Nur-Sultan, Kamaz sales dominate.
- GAZ 3302, GAZ Next, KAMAZ 65115, KAMAZ 43118, ANKAI HFF6850G are the market leaders in commercial vehicle sales by units and dollars.
### Conclusions based on the results of Mercur Auto's market position:
- The company's total revenue is $19,355,310, with an average revenue per company of $30,102.
- The company deals with the Audi, Porsche, and Volkswagen brands. The most profitable brand is Volkswagen. Mercur Auto is the only dealer in Kazakhstan for the Porsche and Audi brands.
- The company's sales dynamics differ significantly from the overall market trend. The market sees growth after winter, peaking in July. In contrast, the company experiences a sharp decline in sales by summer after peaking in May. This is due to Volkswagen replacing four old dealers with one that is clearly affiliated with them. Until May, Mercur Auto was the leader in Volkswagen sales.
- The new Volkswagen dealer managed to surpass the old ones in all regions except the most crucial one - Almaty. In this region, Mercur Auto remains the sales leader.
- Almost all of the company's sales are concentrated in Almaty. The company has minimal sales in Nur-Sultan, which is a potential growth area for the company.
- The company mainly sells SUV and B class cars, which aligns perfectly with the market situation.
- In the SUV class, Mercur Auto holds about 2% of the market. The main competitors with similar market shares are Subaru Kazakhstan, Renault Russia, MMC Rus, Auto Center Bavaria, and Allur Auto.
- In the B class, Mercur Auto holds about 4% of the market. The main competitors with similar market shares are Volkswagen Group Rus (which took over the Volkswagen dealership), Renault Russia, and Ravon Motors Kazakhstan.
- A BCG analysis of Mercur Auto's models was conducted, revealing the following:
   - The "Stars" category is absent, which is extremely concerning but understandable due to Volkswagen issues throughout the year.
   - Only one model falls into the "Cash Cows" category, which is also a worrying sign for the company.
   - Two Porsche models and one Audi model fall into the "Dogs" category. They should not be removed from the portfolio as Mercur Auto has exclusivity for these brands. It might be worth conducting some marketing campaigns involving these brands.
### Recommendations that can be given to Mercur Auto company for business development:
- Try to return the Volkswagen dealership, as this is the most profitable brand of the company. One of the arguments for the return of the dealership: The new dealer cannot cope with maintaining the sales level in Almaty, a key city for car sales.
- If it is not possible to reach an agreement with Volkswagen, then in order to maintain and increase market share, the company needs to take a dealership for some new brand (or several brands). If it does not work out with the market leaders - Toyota, Hyundai, Lada, then in my opinion you can look at brands such as Jac, Nissan, Kia, Ravon, Renault.
- In my opinion, the best solution would be to choose the Kia brand, as it will significantly increase sales in the class, especially in Astana, where the company is clearly not getting ahead in potential sales. Of course, this proposal is based on the assumption that it will not work with any of the leaders - Toyota, Hyundai, Lada. These brands have divided the market among themselves and are unlikely to be interested in the appearance of new dealers.
- In order to increase sales, the company may begin to develop the direction of commercial transport. If it does not work out with the market leaders - Kamaz, GAZ, then in my opinion you can look at brands such as Daewoo, UAZ, Hyundai Truck, MAN.
- In my opinion, the best solution would be to choose the Hyundai Truck or MAN brand, since these brands sell well in Almaty, where Mer—Åur Auto has the strongest positions. If the company decides to increase sales in Astana, including counting the commercial segment, then in this case it is necessary to take a Kamaz dealership, since this brand is best sold in this city.
